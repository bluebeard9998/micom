# MicomTool is scheduled to apply for Xiaomi community bootloader unlock repeatedly &amp; automatically
# What MicomTool Does
This Python script is a tool designed to automate interactions with Xiaomi's community services, for unlocking privileges.
# Here's what it does for users:
1. **Logs You Into Your Xiaomi Account**  
   - The script prompts you to enter your Xiaomi username (e.g., email or phone number) and password securely.
   - It attempts to log in to Xiaomi's authentication server up to 3 times, retrying if there are network issues or invalid credentials.
   - If successful, it retrieves your account's region and session cookies for further use.

2. **Handles Account Verification**  
   - If Xiaomi requires additional verification (e.g., adding an email or phone number), the script notifies you with a specific URL and stops, as manual action is needed.

3. **Schedules and Applies for Privileges**  
   - Once logged in, the script runs an automated process that checks your account's status with Xiaomi's community API every minute.
   - It applies for a specific privilege or authorization (possibly related to bootloader unlocking or community features) with random timing (0-10 seconds jitter) to avoid detection as a bot.
   - It uses accurate time from internet time servers (NTP) to schedule these actions precisely.

4. **Manages Retries and Waiting Periods**  
   - If the application fails (e.g., temporary errors or cooldowns), it retries up to 5 times with a 60-second delay between attempts.
   - If Xiaomi imposes a waiting period (e.g., "retry after X time"), the script waits until that time before trying again.

5. **Provides Feedback and Logs**  
   - The script logs all actions (e.g., login attempts, successes, errors) with timestamps, making it easy to track what’s happening.
   - It informs you if access is granted, including any deadlines, or if something goes wrong.

6. **Runs Continuously Until Stopped**  
   - The script keeps running in a loop, checking and applying every minute, until you stop it manually (e.g., with Ctrl+C) or a critical error occurs, after which it restarts after a delay.

### Purpose for Users
- **Automation**: Saves you from manually checking or applying for Xiaomi community bootloader unlocking repeatedly.
- **Reliability**: Handles network errors, retries, and waiting periods automatically.
- **Use Case**:  intended for users trying to unlock their Xiaomi device’s bootloader by requiring approval from Xiaomi’s community.

---

### How to Use It
- **Requirements**: You need Python installed with the `requests`, `ntplib`, and standard libraries.
- **Running It**: Run the script in a terminal, enter your Xiaomi credentials when prompted, and let it work in the background.
- **Stopping It**: Press Ctrl+C to exit gracefully.

### Notes
- It aligns with bootloader unlocking in mi community.
- If Xiaomi’s policies or APIs change, the script might need updates.
